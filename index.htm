<br>MSG is a simple shooter game design for the microbit V2.</p>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>This microbit shooter game took me around two hours to code every version seen here. I got the idea from microbit game because I wanted an off-line game I can play anywhere where I have access to a 5 V current to power the microbit. I thought a shooter game because it's always fun to shoot something down, Is it not? I added enemies and projectile and the player (You). One feature that I thought was very cool, is that I added is on-bored data logging. This enables me to log the actions, and how many points were affected with that action.</p>
